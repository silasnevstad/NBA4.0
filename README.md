## Overview

A logistic regression model used to predict the probability of a binary which of two teams will win a game. Trained on historical data from 1980 to 2023, which has been preprocessed to create a dataframe containing one-hot encoded features for each team, along with a binary target variable indicating which team won the game.

And a simple GUI created using the PyQt5 library, where one can select two teams and see the models predictions.
